The guiding principle of the McGill Unversity Modelling, Design, and Simulation
Lab is that all tools and processes should be explicitly modelled at an
appropriate abstraction level. This practice ensures that software development
effort is targeted at the problem's essential complexity, while alleviating complexity induced by the computational platforms used.

%This practice goes in the direction of ensuring that essential
%complexity is the main object of software development and that accidental
%complexity is mitigated.

SyVOLT's codebase has been developed by applying these principles. We have used
available model-driven development technology as much as possible, both to
develop and as a part of SyVOLT itself. In particular, we have made it such that
the DSLTrans transformations, the SyVOLT contracts, and path conditions are all represented and treated as models by the proof engine.
 Moreover, we have operationally encoded the
 operations required by the algorithm for building a contract proof (described
 in~\cite{Lucio2014}) as model transformations~\cite{LucioVang}.

The following model-driven development tools have been used in SyVOLT's
development:
\begin{itemize}

%   \item \textbf{AToM$^3$}~\cite{atom3:2002}: AToM$^3$ is a meta-editor for
%   model-driven development.
% %   It has been developed at the MSDL and is used for constructing,
% %   models, metamodels and model transformation rules, and for automatically
% %   synthesising modeling environments.
%   AToM$^3$ has been extensively used to give support to the construction and
%   visualisation of models and model transformation rules required by the proof
%   engine during the initial stages of the construction of SyVOLT. 
% %   Many of these artifacts were explicitely built during the construction
% %   of SyVOLT in order to develop and test the proof algorithm in a controlled
% %   environment. In the finished SyVOLT all these artifacts are automatically
% %   generated from their graphical representations in the Eclipse front-end.\\

  \item \textbf{Himesis}~\cite{Provost2006}: Himesis is a typed graph representation
  format, built upon the open-source igraph\footnote{http://igraph.org/} library. 
% Himesis is used for several reasons: independence, efficiency and tool support.
% Independence is ensured because Himesis is very expressive and also very simple,
% which means it will not change for the foreseeable future.
In \cite{Syriani2010b}, it is reported empirically that Himesis is a good format
to perform the typical graph manipulation operations.
% and it is seamlessly supported by T-Core.
  Himesis is used pervasively within SyVOLT to represent all models 
  and model transformation rules required by the proof algorithm.
  
  \item \textbf{T-Core}~\cite{Syriani2010a}: T-Core is a collection of model transformation
  primitives allowing fine-grained manipulation of models represented in the
  Himesis format.
%   It was initially built as a means to rapidly build
%   high-level model transformation languages. T-Core has been used to
%   successfully deconstruct and reconstruct several mainstream model transformation
%   languages~\cite{}. 
  The main operations of T-Core are model \emph{matching},
  model \emph{rewriting} and \emph{iterating} through a set of match sites in a model.
  The level of control in model manipulation, together with T-Core's speed and
  scalability when treating large models, suited our needs well when
  implementing the property proof algorithm described in~\cite{Lucio2014}. Note that because
  T-Core is also explicitly modelled, a T-Core model transformation rule is also
  a (Himesis) model.

  \item \textbf{Eclipse Modelling Framework} (EMF): SyVOLT makes
  use of EMF's E-Core format for the XMI representation of DSLTrans transformations
  and SyVOLT's contracts within the Eclipse editors.
%   Note that EMF is only used
%   in the Eclipse front-end, and that Ecore models are converted into
%   the Himesis format for the contract prover engine to compute the
%   proofs.\\
  \item \textbf{Epsilon Generation Language} (EGL): Converting
  Ecore models into Himesis models is achieved using EGL, a
  model-to-text transformation language.
% Besides easy integration with Eclipse and native support of the expressive
% Epsilon Object Language (EOL~\cite{Kolovos}), EGL also provides tasks for the
% Ant~\footnote{\url{http://ant.apache.org}} build tool, which was used to
% orchestrate the multiple tools in the proving process (see
% Section~\ref{sec:push_button_proofs}).\\
\end{itemize}

% Elements of the architecture that could not be built using model driven tools
% (for lack of technological availability) have been developed using model-driven
% principles.

Figure~\ref{fig:arch} shows the architecture of our tool, where
squares containing gears represent computations and squares
containing no gears represent produced and consumed data.
Two essential blocks are depicted: the graphical Eclipse front-end for user
interaction and the proof engine back-end which implements the proving algorithm. The front-end and the back-end communicate in the following way:
in the left-to-right direction, a number of artifacts (models and model
transformations) are synthesized from the graphical representations of the
DSLTrans transformations and of the SyVOLT contracts, and passed to the
back-end. In the reverse direction, the proof result and counter-examples, if
any, are passed from the proof engine to the front-end.

Note that in Figure~\ref{fig:arch}, each component is annotated by a number
identifier. Following this numbering sequence, we will briefly visit each
component to describe its function and the technologies employed in its development.

SyVOLT's architectural components described in Figure~\ref{fig:arch} are
orchestrated by an ANT script from within Eclipse. This script makes sure all
components communicate and execute in the right order, and allows contract
proof to run fully automatically at the push of a button.

\subsection*{1. SyVOLT Contract Editor}

%how it was developed
The SyVolt contract editor, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:eclipse_frontend}, is
realized by a set of Eclipse Graphical Modeling Framework\footnote{\url{http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/gmp/}} (GMF) plugins, generated using
EuGENia~\cite{Kolovos2010a}.

%how it is used
The user can prescribe contracts (the gray, red and blue rectangle in the
left-hand side of Figure~\ref{fig:eclipse_frontend}) and propositional logic properties involving
contracts using the toolbox (right-hand side of
Figure~\ref{fig:eclipse_frontend}).

% what's it like internally.
Internally, the graphical editor reads and write two models: the domain model and the graphical model.
The graphical model can be seen as the realization of the concrete syntax by storing the coordinates and other visual information about the shapes that are shown in the graphical editor (Figure~\ref{fig:eclipse_frontend}). 
In contrast, the Ecore domain model contains the abstract syntax: the essence of
the elements that form the contracts and the propositional properties.
%bridge to the next section
The domain model is the artifact used when generating the models for the construction of the proof.


\begin{comment}
Eugenia consists of a set of annotations that are attached to the metamodel of
SyVOLT contracts. An annotation can, for instance, specify that an atomic
contract will be drawn as a rounded rectangle, with a specific color and a label
that is equal to the name attribute of the contract.
The annotations are not very expressive but they contain the essential
information to generate a set of GMF models that, ultimately, describe a basic
usable graphical editor.
Each generated GMF model is concerned with one aspect of the editor and can be
further customized to our needs. GMF models are much more expressive than the
Eugenia annotations.
For instance, the generated GMF tooling model prescribes the kind of tools that
will be available in the toolbox (shown in the right of
Figure~\ref{fig:eclipse_frontend}), their icons, labels, etc\ldots

From the set of GMF models, a set of eclipse plugins are synthesized.
These make up SyVolt graphical editor\footnote{A fixed structure textual editor
is also provided but this editor lacks several usability improvements and,
hence, is not appropriate to model SyVolt contracts.}.

The original DSLTrans transformation is manipulated using the DSLTrans editor
and is serialized in XMI format. Similarly, SyVOLT contracts are manipulated with the SyVolt graphical
editor and serialized in XMI format.

\subsection*{2. Generating Rule and Contract Artifacts}
\label{sec:gen_models_mt}

The translation of DSLTrans transformations and SyVOLT contracts into Himesis
models and model transformation rules was achieved using the EGL. Specifically, two EGL model-to-text
transformations were used: one to generate the Himesis models
representing a DSLTrans transformation (marked (a) in Figure~\ref{fig:arch});
and another one to generate the T-Core model transformation rules necessary to prove
SyVOLT contracts (marked (b) in Figure~\ref{fig:arch}).

From the preEcore models of the DSLTrans model transformation under analysis and
of the contracts to be proved, the EGL transformations produce a number of Python
classes that inherit from the Himesis library and that represent models and
T-Core transformation rules. These classes will be subsequently loaded in memory
and manipulated by the proof engine back-end.


% Note that all these artifacts are produced as
% Python text files containing Himesis format that are needed to automatically
% perform the required proofs.
% containing models of the DSLTrans transformation being analysed
% and the T-Core model transformation rules necessary for the property proof step.

% Note that, while this approach of building models and model transformations as
% textual files is sufficient for our needs, it is not ideal from the model-driven
% development viewpoint. Building models as textual files forces us to deal to
% the accidental complexity of Python code and of the Himesis format, making the
% generation of these artifacts more difficult and error prone than it needs to
% be. The issues encountered here expose one of the current important fragilities
% of model-driven development: the difficulty of exchanging high-level data
% between different modelling frameworks~\levi{cite benoit combemale here}.


% As opposed to the XMI format which declaratively represents the graph, the
% Himesis representation of a graph is given by Python code referencing the
% Himesis library. When this code is executed it loads the Himesis graph to
% memory.

% Since Himesis is a textual format, identifiers are necessary to correctly
% describe the associations between graph nodes. The EGL transformations make sure
% these are correctly generated.


\subsection*{3. Generating Artifacts for Path Condition Generation}

Additional artifacts need to be generated for the property proof
algorithm to execute. These are the \emph{path condition generation} T-Core
model transformations (marked (c) in Figure~\ref{fig:arch}) that are needed to
perform the model manipulations for a set of path conditions. These model
transformation blocks allow combining the rules of a DSLTrans model
transformation into a set of \emph{path conditions}, as per the algorithm
described in~\cite{Lucio2014}.

This additional model transformation generation step is achieved by the PyRamify
component. PyRamify is a Python script that takes as input Himesis graphs
representing the rules in the transformation. Then, T-Core matchers and
rewriters for each rule are produced. While matchers allow the contract prover to determine
if and how rules might combine with a path condition under construction,
rewriters combine the right-hand side of a DSLTrans rule with that same path
condition.

% PyRamify is also responsible for producing additional T-Core model
% transformations used for analysing how the DSLTrans rules in a transformation
% depend on each other. Explain this further??

% Currently, PyRamify is implemented as a Python script, as we were unable to
% implement at the time automatic creation of higher-order artifacts (in our
% case, T-Core transformations) from models in another modelling tool.
% This was due to the mix of different modelling abstraction levels present in
% SyVOLT and that led to a number of technical difficulties.
% 
% We have recently learned that, alternatively, \emph{path condition generation
% transformations} could be built directly from the Ecore representation of
% DSLTrans rules by using EGL technology -- as was done for the artifacts
% described in Section~\ref{sec:gen_models_mt}. Nevertheless, a preferred solution for us would
% be to use model transformation technology that that explicitely allows
% building model transformations from simple models. To the best of our knowledge,
% model transformation technology that allows moving between models of a given
% order $n$ and an order $n+1$ is not yet available in the modelling community.

\subsection*{4. Path Condition Generation}
\label{sec:path_cond_gen}

Once the required artifacts have been produced, the prover moves onto the path
condition generation step. Path condition generation is operationally achieved
by executing the appropriate T-Core transformation rules (artifact (c) in
Figure~\ref{fig:arch}), following the ordering of the rules in the DSLTrans transformation being analysed.
The path condition generation algorithm starts from the empty path condition,
representing the case where no rules in the transformation have executed. Then, each rule in the DSLTrans model transformation under analysis
is combined with the path conditions generated thus far, using a T-Core
transformation rule matcher and rewriter. As each rule is considered, the set
of path conditions will grow to represent all allowed rules combinations. As the execution of a rule in a DSLTrans
transformation may depend on the previous execution of other rules, such
dependencies are verified by the path condition generation
transformations in order to exclude impossible rule combinations.

% The final set of path conditions produced by the algorithm will then abstract
% the infinite set of all concrete transformation executions. This is further
% described in~\cite{Lucio2014}, along with a formal discussion of the validity
% and completeness of this work.

% Note that path condition generation is a complex task, difficult to fully
% model as a single model transformation. As such, the algorithm in this component
% has been implemented as a Python script that is responsible for scheduling all the
% path condition generation transformations in the right order. This programmatic level of granularity of
% manipulation has allowed us to build many optimizations to speed up the path
% condition generation process. Examples of such optimizations are the caching of
% expensive match operations, or the parallelization of the path condition generation algorithm. 
 
\subsection*{5. Contract Proof}

The \emph{contract proof} component requires two inputs: the \emph{path
conditions set} built by the path condition generator (marked (d) in Figure~\ref{fig:arch}); the \emph{contract
proof T-Core transformations} (marked (b) in Figure~\ref{fig:arch}).
Pre-/post- condition contracts form an implication, which needs to be checked
for each path condition provided as input to the contract proof component. For a
contract to hold on a DSLTrans model transformation, the contract's implication
should hold for every path condition generated for that model transformation.
For each submodel of the path condition that is isomorphic to the
pre-condition's model, the appropriate property T-Core matcher from the artifact marked (b) will try to find
a submodel of the path condition that is isomorphic to the post-condition's
model. 
% As in for the path condition generation component described in
% Section~\ref{sec:path_cond_gen}, the contract proof algorithm has also been
% implemented as a Python script that schedules all the property proof T-Core
% transformations appropriately. As before, using fine-grained programmatic
% manipulations of the models and model transformations involved in the contract
% proof algorithm has allowed us to implement optimization strategies during
% contract proof. The main of these strategies is the skipping of path conditions
% for which the contract is sure to hold without further analysis, given
% some existing cached information about similar path conditions.
